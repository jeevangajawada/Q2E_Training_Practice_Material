Any website reference where we can find the different connection strings and jar to be used for all databases?
docs.oracle.com


Just wanted to clarify whether the below are the steps involved in JDBC are correct ?

1) Start the Apache and Database(MySQL) server
2) Java/Java EE Perspective -> Create a Java project for JDBC and create package and class
3) Add the 'mysql...' Jar to the build path (For every database the jar file differs)
4) Start the main database connection code and perform the select/update/delete etc.,


Is it mandatory that we have to start the server manually everytime, Can we launch this automatically using java code ?
